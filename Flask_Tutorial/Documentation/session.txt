The session can be defined as the duration for which a user logs into the server and logs out. The data which is used to track this session is stored into the temporary directory on the server.

session data is stored on server.

The session data is stored on the top of cookies and signed by the server cryptographically.

In the flask, a session object is used to track the session data which is a dictionary object that contains a key-value pair of the session variables and their associated values.

The following syntax is used to set the session variable to a specific value on the server.

Session[<variable-name>] = <value>  

To remove a session variable, use the pop() method on the session object and mention the variable to be removed.

session.pop(<variable-name>, none)
