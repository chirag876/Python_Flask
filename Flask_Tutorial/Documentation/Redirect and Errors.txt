Flask class provides the redirect() function which redirects the user to some specified URL with the specified status code.

An HTTP status code is a response from the server to the request of the browser. When we visit a website, a request is sent to the server, and the server then responds to the browser's request with a three-digit code: the HTTP status code. This status code also represents the error.

The syntax to use the redirect() function is given below.

Flask.redirect(<location>,<status-code>, <response> ) 

1 location: It is the URL where the response will be redirected.

2 status code: It is the status code that is sent to the browser's header along with the response from the server.
