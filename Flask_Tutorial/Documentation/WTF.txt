WTF stands for WT Forms which is intended to provide the interactive user interface for the user. The WTF is a built-in module of the flask which provides an alternative way of designing forms in the flask web applications.

Why WTF Useful?

1. The form elements are sent along with the request object from the client side to the server side. Server-Side script needs to recreate the form elements since there is no direct mapping between the client side form elements and the variables to be used at the server side.

2. There is no way to render the HTML form data at real time.

The WT Forms is a flexible, form rendering, and validation library used to provide the user interface.
